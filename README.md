# Interactive-Instructional-Device-
Included in this repository is my final first-year engineering design project that integrated custom built hardware, software, and electrical components to develop an interactive instructional device that improves the education available for the concept of the "Moment of Inertia" at a high school level. This project was the result of my passion for using technology and engineering to make education more intuitive and accessible to willing students all around the world. The final report includes all details regarding the problem, developed solution, and conclusion.
